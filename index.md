## Who are you?

...and what do you hope to get from this workshop?

---

# This workshop...

## will be:

A practical introduction to a powerful stack of free, open-source web tools for geospatial web development.

We're going to focus on a hands-on approach to learning the basics of:

- PostgreSQL/PostGIS (spatially-enabled RDBMS)

- Geoserver (Geospatial data server)

- Leaflet (JavaScript mapping library)

--

## won't be:

A thorough academic explanation of GIS or related concepts.  We're not going to spend a lot of time talking about the basics of:

- GIS

- RDBMS/SQL

- JavaScript

- HTML/CSS

...but we're going to try to keep things simple and easy, so don't worry if you're not an expert - some basic comfort and confidence will suffice.
